# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'


# Temporary files
tmp
*~
**/.DS_Store
*.swp
*.swo
*.swn
*.swm
*.swl
*.swj
tags

# Git merge orig files
*.orig

# misc
.DS_Store
